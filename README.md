DISCLAIMER: While this SPAM SMS detection model has been trained on a dataset with a reported accuracy of 98.44%, occasional inaccuracies in predictions may occur. Please use with caution and verify results in critical applications.

To build this spam detection machine learning model I have used BAG OF WORDS MODEL of Natural Language Processing.After Processing 
the messages I have ran the following classification algorithms:K-Nearest-Neighbours(accuracy=94.97%), Naive Bayes algorithm(accuracy=89.11%),
Decision Tree Classification algorithm(96.77%), Random Forest Classification Algorithm(accuracy=97.24%), Multinomial Naive Bayes
Algorithm(accuracy=98.44%),Logistic Regression(accuracy=98.08%) and Support Vector Machine Algorithm(accuracy=97.96%).

To calculate the accuracy of model I have divided the dataset into Training and Testing set with 85:15 ratio

I have selected Multinomial Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm , Because it is accurate to 98.44%
